## Summary

QuantEcon Bookshelf is an open notebook gallery and archive that hosts 
Jupyter notebooks related to all areas of economics and econometrics.

Anyone can submit a notebook on either of these topics. Peer review is
conducted purely by the free market, in the form of upvotes and downvotes.

We encourage submissions containing either original material or replications
of existing studies in an open and reproducible manner.  Users are encouraged
both to submit their own material and also to vote and comment on existing
submissions.

We hope that votes will be determined by the quality and perceived value of
the content of a given notebook to economic research and public policy.

One the site goes beyond beta status, URLs to individual notebooks will be
permanent and can be used in citations.

QuantEcon Bookshelf is a [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) project funded by
the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) and designed and built by
the team listed below.
