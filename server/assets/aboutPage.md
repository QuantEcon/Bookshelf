# Summary

QuantEcon Notes is a public repository that hosts Jupyter notebooks related to
all areas of economics and econometrics.

**Anyone can submit a notebook on either of these topics.**

We encourage submissions containing either original material or replications
of existing studies in an open and reproducible manner.  Peer review is
conducted purely by the free market, in the form of upvotes and downvotes.

Our objective is to facilitate communication between economists and enhance
reproducibility in research.

URLs to individual notebooks will be permanent and can be used in citations.

QuantEcon Notes is a [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org) project funded by
the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/).

# FAQs

1. **Can you handle supporting files?**  

  Not yet, but we're getting there.  

2. **Is this site only for economics?**  

  Yes, with room for some finance or operations research if it closely relates
  to economics. Please downvote or [alert us](mailto:contact@quantecon.org) to content that you think is off
  topic.

3. **What should I do if I find an issue with the website?**  

  [Contact us](mailto:contact@quantecon.org)

4. **How do I include an image in my Jupyter notebook?**

  Currently we don't support including additional files. If you'd like to link an image in a Markdown cell, you will need to host the image somewhere (refer [here](https://commonmark.org/help/) for Markdown syntax).
  If you would like to include an image without hosting, we recommend using `from IPython.display import Image`.
